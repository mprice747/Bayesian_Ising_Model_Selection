# Bayesian_Ising_Model_Selection
The Ising Model, although having its roots in physics, is a convenient way to model multidimensional binary data. However, when performing Bayesian inference, it can be difficult to conclude which parameters are noninformative. The goal of this project was to propose a posterior summarization framework for the Bayesian Ising model, with a focus on identifying and removing spurious correlations within the model. All code is available in the .Rmd file. See paper for detailed mathematical overview of algorithm.
